## Yes, that's a rainbow shooting out of my head

![rainbow](/media/herb-rainbow-web.jpg)

There's a good reason this is barebones. I'm busy. But I like what it offers so I'm slowly starting to use it more to tell more about myself.

Lately, I've been interested in simplifying the process of meeting the needs of our clients. Instead of offering a full-package solution that includes Drupal and CiviCRM, we should be thinking of providing the minimum amount of functionality that meets their needs. That is partly why I'm now trying out github pages for my own personal information. I don't need a lot and I've been using markdown for awhile on my other blog.

Drupal can be quite powerful and we still end up using it for most projects, but clients seldom need everything that it has to offer and it is hard to resist the urge to turn on many features just because it's possible.
