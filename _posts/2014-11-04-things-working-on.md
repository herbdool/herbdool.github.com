## Notable development tools and processes I've been working on

I've been working on a number of Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrades. When it comes down to it, many of them take just as much work as an entirely new site.

### Migrating content
Using the [migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate) and [migrate_d2d](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_d2d) modules to script the mapping of fields from a Drupal 6 site to a fresh Drupal 7 site.

### Using better deployment tools
I've had the chance to start using [Pantheon](http://getpantheon.com) for one of our clients and it's pretty awesome. It makes deployment and development much easier.

We've also started using [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com) to help with deployment on projects where we can't put them on something like Pantheon. This is the only way we've been able to use version control across all projects. There has been some resistance to this at work.
