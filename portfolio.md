## Who I've worked with

I work for [Freeform Solutions](https://freeform.ca) where've done work for a number of small and large clients, building Drupal 7, Drupal 8, Backdrop CMS and WordPress websites. I've also got a deep understanding of CiviCRM and have done a lot of work to make it work better on modern hosting containers.

I also do contract Drupal work for a few businesses/organizations, including: [Dale & Lessmann LLP](https://dalelessmann.com), [Frontiers Foundation](http://frontiersfoundation.ca), [Transport Futures](http://transportfutures.ca), [Paul Penna Downtown Jewish Day School](http://djds.ca), [Agricultural Employment](http://www.agriemploy.com/), and my personal websites [I Bike TO](https://ibiketo.ca) and [Cargo Bikes in Canada](https://cargobike.ca).

I've also previously done contract work for [Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario](http://rnao.ca/), Centre for Addictions and Mental Health ([Scarborough Addiction Services Partnership](http://scarboroughaddictionservices.org), [Toronto Drug Treatment Court](http://tdtc.ca)), and [Cycle Toronto](http://cycleto.ca) (Drupal + CiviCRM).
