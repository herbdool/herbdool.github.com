  I've strived to keep my personal site simple and easy to manage. This also gives me a chance to try out Jekyll and Github Pages.

## Introduction

I am a Web Developer in Ontario, Canada. I've been developing Drupal and Backdrop CMS websites for the last few years for a variety of non-profits. I've also been working with and contributing back to CiviCRM heavily. And sometimes I even build with WordPress, depending on the needs of the client.
